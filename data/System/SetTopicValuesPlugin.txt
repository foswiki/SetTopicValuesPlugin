---++ Usage
This Plugin adds the ability to use some of the Topic Object model addressing introduced in QuerySearch to modify values.

(only supports PREFERENCES and FIELDS - the others will come with the Foswiki:Development.AddMetaSetActionToEditAndSave Foswiki 1.1 feature.

In essence, this plugin adds =Set+= and =Unset+= urlparams to the [[%SCRIPTURL{view}%/System/CommandAndCGIScripts#save][=save=]] Script.

---+++ =save=
The =save= script performs a range of save-related functions, as selected by the =action= parameter.

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =set+SomeTOM=someValue= | Set a META PREFERENCE or FormFIELD to a value | |
| =unset+SomeTOM= | unset (ie remove) a META PREFERENCE or FormFIELD | |

Be aware that while you _can_ set a FormFIELD that is not specified in the topics FORM, the next save will remove it.

For security reasons, the rvalues are entityEncoded before being saved. 
This means you cannot set a a preference or formfield to  another TML MACRO - just constant strings.


---++ Examples
   * =http://somewhere.com/save/Sandbox/TestTopic5?set+VIEW_TEMPLATE=SomeValue=
   * =http://somewhere.com/save?set+Sandbox.TestTopic5/preferences[VIEW_TEMPLATE]=SomeValue=
      * adds a META PREFERENCE (or potentially edits an existing in-text Setting?) 
   * =http://somewhere.com/save?unset+Sandbox.TestTopic5/preferences[VIEW_TEMPLATE]=

---++ Technical details
So that URL settings can be used to set the values on a topic that is being created, it uses the =afterSaveHandler=.

To simplify the implementation, PREFERENCES are all stored in the META::PREFERENCES, not inline in the topic.
